    history:
      "St. Charles Lwanga (c. 1860-1886) was a Ugandan Catholic convert and leader among the royal pages of King Mwanga II. He protected young boys from the king's sexual abuse and encouraged them to stay strong in their Christian faith. For refusing to renounce Christianity, he was burned alive on June 3, 1886, at Namugongo, along with other Christian converts. He was canonized in 1964 and is now the patron saint of youth in Africa. His feast day is June 3",
